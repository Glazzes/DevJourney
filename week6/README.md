## June 2023 week 3

### Week [6][6] Borealis UI rework
After the initial deployment of borealis in github pages i could help but feel sick of how bad it looks and its lack of features, as of yesterfay I've started an UI rework. Project will be deployed on Oracle Cloud


### Week [6][7] Oracle Cloud free tier is GOD!!!
Oracle cloud free tier includes two 1 CPU 1GB RAM instances where you can do whatever you want with them, as well as having two Oracle databases for fullstack projects, I've already deployed boralis old ui, new ui preview as well as backend to the same instance, avialable at http://129.148.58.84/ for the old ui and http://129.148.58.84/ for the new ui preview
