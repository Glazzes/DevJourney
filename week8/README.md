### [8][1] React Native Web and Borealis Editor
I've been working on my borealis editor for a week now, I've been using expo and react native web for it, it has been a great experience overall, but i can not help but notice the huge size when compared to a normal react application, from 300 Kb or less up 1.2 MB.

Aside from that project is going well, made the following changes:
- Added close tab shortcut
- Moved update active tab to shortcut themselves
- Created an information modal
- Refactored DatabaseService for reading readability
