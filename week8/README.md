## July 2023, Week 1

### [8][1] React Native Web and Borealis Editor
I've been working on my borealis editor for a week now, I've been using expo and react native web for it, it has been a great experience overall, but i can not help but notice the huge size when compared to a normal react application, from 300 Kb or less up 1.2 MB.

Aside from that project is going well, made the following changes:
- Added close tab shortcut
- Moved update active tab to shortcut themselves
- Created an information modal
- Refactored DatabaseService for reading readability

### [8][2] Borealis and portfolio improvements
Today i worked on my portfolio and borealis projects, doing the following things to borealis:
- Add close tab shortcut modal appearing
- Add feature to read text files and prompt its content to the code editor
- Add functionality to create new tab button

As for my portfolio, i fixed some typos as well as adding missing links.
