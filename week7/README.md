## June 2023, week 4

### Week[4][5] IndexedDB First Time
Today i worked on my side project's new ui, borealis editor, IndexedDB has been on my rader for quite a while, today i decided to give a try, it's pretty is pretty weird to say the laest, but i managed to implement the following features on my react app thanks to it (they could have been implemente with local storage tho)
- Save tab content
- Delete tabs
- Get tabs at startup

### Week[4][7] Flutter vs React Native: Styling comparasion
I've tried Flutter for the first time in while, today. I've been using react native for the last two years, but there's a thing that I really creave for and that great UI capabilties missing and/or way harder to implement in react native such as:
- Box shadows
- Blend modes (For replacing colors)
- Bur backgound

When it comes to styling both differ a lot, where react native has all of it's properties whitin the same object and can be accesible by any component, Flutter distributes it's properties along many different widgets, let's a couple:
- Flex direction: Row, Colum
- Position: Stack, Positioned
- View decoraction properties: BoxDecoration

I can't say wheter this is wrong or not, but i certainly find it annoying with my react background, I'll keep learning it as I find it to be a great solution for complex UI scenarios where React Native won't shine.
