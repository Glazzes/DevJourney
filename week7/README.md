### IndexedDB First Time
Today i worked on my side project's new ui, borealis editor, IndexedDB has been on my rader for quite a while, today i decided to give a try, it's pretty is pretty weird to say the laest, but i managed to implement the following features on my react app thanks to it (they could have been implemente with local storage tho)
- Save tab content
- Delete tabs
- Get tabs at startup
