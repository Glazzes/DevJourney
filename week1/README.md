## May 2023, Week one

### Week[1][1]: Cloud Native

I just happened to get my hands on a copy of [Cloud Native Spring in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-spring-in-action) book, i've reading it for the last couple of days and the way it's explains what a cloud native application is and how cloud providers are an escencial part of it is very fascinating to me, i'm currently on chapter two where it explains to use [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/), never heard of them before, but it seems that's how [JIB](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-gradle-plugin) does it's magic, but with extra tasks such as container creation and registry publication.

### Week[1][3]: AWS in my PC?

[Localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) is a software that allows you to use AWS in your machine thorugh a docker container, i've digging more about it, and it seems it has a lot of free services to use like S3, DynamoDB and Lambda, but it does also have a paid version where it includes even more services.

I must create a project to implement S3, DynamoDB and lambda into a single project.


### Week[1][5] The devil is on the details
I recently took an exam about Java and Spring Boot, it gave me a lot of insight of my strenghts are weaknesses, i discovered my knowlegde of Spring Boot and Spring Security it's on point, but in the case of Java, well, i found out that i'm lacking some knowlegde of specific java language details, therefore i've decided to improve on that by using an [Oracle Certified Professional](https://www.amazon.com/Oracle-Certified-Professional-Developer-Study/dp/1119864585) study guide.
