## Developer Journey Log

I've decided to create some sort of a developer "diary" (on a weekly basis) where i can take notes of the awesome stuff i learn everyday related to the tech world as a way to track my progress.

What can i'm gonna write of:
- Things i'm learning
- Thins i'm currently developing
- Coding books i'm reading

Check out any week:
// TODO
