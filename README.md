## Developer Journey Log

Welcome to my developer journey! I've decided to create a log (on a weekly basis) where I'm gonna document my new programming findings, learing experiencies and progress towards becoming a professional software developer, once I reach this goal, I will keep writing of the same things but with a bran new different mindset.

Things you can read about in this repo:
- Things I'm currently learning
- Thins I'm currently developing
- New programming concepts I've learnt
- Coding books i'm reading
