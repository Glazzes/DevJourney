## May 2023, Week Two

### Week[2][1] Kubernetes vs Spring Cloud Eureka
Kubernetes is a very appealing technology to me, as stated by [Cloud Native Spring in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-spring-in-action)'s second chapter, it has built in service discovery as well as load balancing capabilities leavig Spring Cloud Eureka in a second place, SOOOOO when using OpenFeign interfaces, should i refer to a deployment or the service to talk to the application instances? That's something i must find out later on the book.

### Week[2][6] Frontend Testing
Today i decided to give a look to frontend testing, i'm used already to test my backend applications, but not so much on the frontend, i just of testing library and jest today, as well as mocking with `jest.fn`
